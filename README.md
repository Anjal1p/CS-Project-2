# CS-Project-2
CS 2336 project working with LinkedLists

The main purpose of the program is to implement LinkedList using classes and perform other function such as searching, sorting, printing, etc. using the LinkedList object. It takes input from two files in which it calculates areas of pilots with      given coordinates from the first file and sorts/searches the list based on user input from the second file and prints the results to their corresponding output files.
